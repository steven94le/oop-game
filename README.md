# Introduction :wave:

Our first bootcamp project was done using vanilla JavaScript (focusing on object-oriented programming and DOM manipulation). A simple game where you need to dodge incoming projectiles that progressively speed up and increase in number as the game goes on. A point is granted for every second the user stays alive. Design elements inspired by Pokemon. All images were found online.
